  <h2 onclick="toggleVisibility('mentalHealthList', this)">Mental Health Tips <span class="arrow">▶</span></h2>
  <ul id="mentalHealthList">
    <li><b>Mindful Moments:</b> Take a few minutes each day to practice mindfulness. Close your eyes, take deep breaths, and focus on the present moment. It can help you feel calm and centered.</li>
    <li><b>Talk It Out:</b> If you're feeling sad, anxious, or overwhelmed, don't be afraid to talk to someone you trust, like a parent, friend, or teacher. Sharing your feelings can lighten the load.</li>
    <li><b>Positive Thinking:</b> Try to focus on the good things in your life. Keeping a gratitude journal, where you write down things you're thankful for, can boost your mood and mental well-being.</li>
    <li><b>Self-Care Time:</b> Make time for activities that make you happy, whether it’s reading, drawing, or listening to music. Taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your body.</li>

  <ul id="commonHealthList">
    <li><b>Colds & Flu:</b> If you’re feeling under the weather, rest up and drink plenty of fluids. Washing your hands often and avoiding close contact with sick people can help prevent catching a cold or flu.</li>
    <li><b>Sleep Well:</b> Getting enough sleep is crucial for your health. Aim for 8-10 hours each night. A good sleep routine includes going to bed at the same time each night and keeping your room cool and dark.</li>
    <li><b>Stress Relief:</b> If you’re feeling stressed, try deep breathing, meditation, or talking to someone you trust. Activities like drawing, listening to music, or spending time outside can also help you relax.</li>
    <li><b>Healthy Screen Time:</b> Too much screen time can strain your eyes and keep you from getting enough sleep. Try to take breaks every 20 minutes and limit your screen time before bed.</li>
